Project Overview
The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a web-based application developed in .NET to streamline the process of submitting, reviewing, and approving monthly claims for independent contractor lecturers. The system is designed to improve transparency, efficiency, and accuracy for lecturers, programme coordinators, and academic managers involved in the claims process.

User Roles:
Lecturers: Can submit claims and upload supporting documents.
Programme Coordinators: Can review and either approve or reject claims.
Academic Managers: Have the same privileges as Programme Coordinators but also manage higher-level approval tasks.
Features
Lecturer Claim Submission:

Lecturers can submit claims, specifying the number of hours worked, hourly rate, and any additional notes.
Supporting documents (e.g., timesheets, invoices) can be uploaded with the claim.
Programme Coordinator Review:

Programme Coordinators can view submitted claims, verify details, and either approve or reject them.
Claims can be filtered by status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
Academic Manager Role:

Academic Managers can perform the same tasks as Programme Coordinators, including claim approval, rejection, and viewing uploaded supporting documents.
Document Upload and Viewing:

Claims support uploading and viewing supporting documents for verification.
Documents can be opened directly from the application.
User Authentication:

Users (Lecturers, Coordinators, Academic Managers) must log in before accessing the system.
Claim Status Tracking:

Claims move through different stages (Pending, Approved, Rejected), and their status can be tracked in real-time by the user who submitted the claim.
